In this lightning talk, we will have a look at Ink - a wonderful custom React renderer that allows us to use Flexbox to create excellent command-line interfaces with ease.

# Command-Line Interfaces

<Notes>
<h2>
So, today we are going to talk about building Command Line Interface apps.
</h2>
</Notes>

---

# CLIs and terminals have been with us since the 60s

# It's almost 2020, so why? <Emoji svg text="🤔" />

<Notes>
<h2>
But these kind of applications have already been there since the 60s, I mean it's almost 2020 now, so why do we still bother building them?
</h2>
</Notes>

---
  <h1>
    Old, but not obsolete <Emoji svg text="💡" />
  </h1>
<Appear>
  <div>
     <h3><i>Think git, CRA, test runners...</i></h3>
     <h2>Practical, fast, developer-friendly!</h2>
  </div>
  <h2>Your next big project might need a CLI companion!</h2>
</Appear>

<Notes>
<h3>
Well, as it turns out, these apps are still extremely relevant today.
</h3>

<h3>
And especially if you are a developer, we rely on CLI apps like git, create-react-app daily, because they are fast and practical.
</h3>

<h3>
And if you are building a library or framework, a CLI companion app, maybe one that helps bootstrapping new projects, would be super valuable to the end users as part of the toolchain.
</h3>
</Notes>

# How do we start

## building a CLI app with Node?

<Notes>
<h2>
So how do we start building them with JavaScript and node?
</h2>
</Notes>

---

We start simple...

```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

then run  <i> `node index.js`</i>

# <Emoji svg text=":D" />

<Notes>
<h2>
Well, surprisingly easy - we just save console.log "hello world" to a JS file and run it with Node.
</h2>
</Notes>

---

## But how can we make things more interesting?

### Bold, italics, colors, updates...

<Notes>
<h2>
But if we want to make things a little bit more interesting, like make the font bold, render colors, or update what's already printed to the screen...
</h2>
</Notes>

---

# ANSI escape code

<Mono big>ANSI === "American National Standards Institute"</Mono>

<Appear>
  <h3>
    Boy they are ugly <Emoji svg text="😅" />
  </h3>
</Appear>

<Notes>
<h2>
We will need ANSI escape sequences to do this.
</h2>

<h2>
And they are super ugly if we just use them directly.
</h2>

</Notes>

---

## If we want to print colored text... <Emoji svg text="🤔" />

<Notes>
<h2>
So if we want to print colored text for example,
</h2>
</Notes>

import ReactDayBerlin from "./ReactDayBerlin.js";

```js
console.log(
  "\u001b[44m" + // Blue background
  "\u001b[37m" + // White text
  "\u001b[1m" + // Bold font
  "ReactDay" + // Payload 1
  "\u001b[47m" + // White background
  "\u001b[31m" + // Red text
  "Berlin" + // Payload 2
    "\u001b[0m" // Reset styling
);
```

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    flexDirection: "row",
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
>
  <h2 style={{ margin: "5rem" }}>
    <Emoji svg text="👉" />
  </h2>
  <ReactDayBerlin />
</div>

<Notes>
<h2>
We'll then need to write a whole bunch of nonsense non-printable stuff to do the formatting. And we'll have to always remember to reset styling at the end.
</h2>
</Notes>

---

## If we want to update printed text... <Emoji svg text="🤔" />

<Notes>

And if we want to update printed text,

### A simple clock

```js
function simpleClock() {
  setInterval(() => {
    const time = moment().format("h:mm:ss a");
    process.stdout.write("\u001b[1000D\u001b[K");
    process.stdout.write(time);
  }, 1000);
}
```

Move 1000 columns to the left, remove everything till end of the line

<Notes>
<h2>
For example to print this simple clock that update the current time, we will need to do stuff like this.
</h2>
</Notes>

---

### Layouts in a pure text environment are even tougher <Emoji svg text="😕" />

### And we want to update multiple chunks simultaneously... <Emoji svg text="😂" />

<Notes>
<h2>
And not to mention that today we can resize our terminal windows, so we can't hardcode the height and width anymore.
</h2>
<h2>
And things get even trickier when we want to update chunks of the UI simultaneously...
</h2>
</Notes>

---

### Jest's running and watch mode

<div
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
      <video
        style="max-width: 60%"
        loop
        autoplay
        muted
        src="./images/jest.mp4"
      />
    `,
  }}
/>

Real time status <Emoji svg text="🧭" /> Keyboard interaction <Emoji svg text="👨‍💻" />

<Notes>
<h2>
Like Jest's CLI for example.
</h2>
</Notes>

## Behold, we have `Ink`! <Emoji svg text="🌈" />

![Ink logo](./images/ink-logo.png)

*from @vadimdemedes and @sindresorhus*

<Appear>
  <div style={{ marginTop: "4em" }}>
    <h3>
      <Emoji svg text="✅" /> Custom React renderer
    </h3>
    <h3>
      <Emoji svg text="✅" /> Flexbox magic in the terminal <Emoji svg text="🤯" />
    </h3>
  </div>
</Appear>

<Notes>
<h2>
That's when Ink comes into the rescue.
</h2>

<h2>
It's a custom React renderer that renders components to text, with all the ANSI stuff together.
</h2>

<h2>
And it lets us use Flexbox for the layout. How cool is that?
</h2>
</Notes>

---

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Text, Box, Color, useInput, render } from "ink";
import Gradient from "ink-gradient";
import BigText from "ink-big-text";
import Spinner from "ink-spinner";
import TextInput from "ink-text-input";
import Ascii from "ink-ascii";
```

Import built-in & 3rd party Ink components <Emoji svg text="☝️" />

<Notes>
<h2>
So building Ink apps is like building any other React apps. We import the stuff we need, and we write custom components.
</h2>
</Notes>

---

## An example?

<img src="./images/wiki-client.png" />

<Notes>
<h2>
For example, if we want to build something like this wiki app,
</h2>
</Notes>

---

```jsx
const AppContext = createContext();
const Wiki = () => {
  // init keypress handling, useStates and so on...
  return (
    <AppContext.Provider value={{ ...statesAndSetters }}>
      <Box flexDirection="column" marginY={1}>
        <InstantSearchBar />
        <ResultsListing />
        <StatusInfoBar />
      </Box>
    </AppContext.Provider>
  );
};

render(<Wiki />);
```

Just like building any React app <Emoji svg text="☝️" />

<Notes>
<h2>
We can write JSX for the UI, as simple as that.
</h2>
</Notes>

---

<div
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
    __html: `
      <video
        style="height: 90vh;"
        loop
        autoplay
        muted
        src="./images/demo-wiki.mp4"
      />
    `,
  }}
/>

<Notes>
<h2>
And here's how it looks like
</h2>
</Notes>

### More awesomeness with Ink

<Image src="./images/ink-mdx.png" style={{height: "70vh", width: "70vw"}} size="contain" />

MDX rendered directly to the terminal!

<Notes>
<h2>
And with Ink, we can actually also render MDX to the terminal. This would be very useful for building help manuals for the app.
</h2>
</Notes>

---

### Even more awesomeness with Ink

<Image src="./images/pastel-logo.png" style={{height: "50vh", width: "50vw"}} size="contain" />

<Notes>
<h2>
And with a framework based on Ink called Pastel
</h2>
</Notes>

---

```text
git-js/
  - package.json
  - commands/
    - index.js
    - add.js
    - checkout.js
    - commit.js
    - stash/
      - index.js
      - clear.js
      - pop.js
        ...
```

`git stash pop` anyone?

<Notes>
<h2>
We can even build a CLI app like a Next.js app, the difference here is that instead of different routes, we have different subcommands.
</h2>

<h2>
Super cool!
</h2>

</Notes>

---

## Check out `react-blessed` too!

### Renders to `blessed` widgets

### More suitable for fullscreen apps

<Notes>
<h2>
There's another library that let's us write React for CLI apps, called react-blessed, and it's more suitable for fullscreen apps like a text editor.
</h2>
</Notes>
